        <h1>Depression</h1>
        <p>It's pretty obvious that depression, anxiety, and related illnesses have become far too widespread today. Especially in teenagers, we see an ever-increasing rate of both depression and general anxiety.</p>
        <p>Many try to find a cause; some find a suitable one, and demonize it for all eternity.</p>
        <p>And where do most teenagers go to?</p>
        <p>The wrong place.</p>
        <h2>Excuses, excuses...</h2>
        <p>I have seen it absolutely everywhere: school. It is unbelievable the amount of teenagers who will blame school on their extreme depression and anxiety.</p>
        <p>It makes sense at the surface: when students are overloaded with work that they can't do, it creates chronic stress, which creates anxiety. Seems like it must be causing anxiety!</p>
        <p>Well, what about depression? Oh no, that has the same cause! Chronic stress, work overload, and high standards!</p>
        <p>It just seems logical to conclude that it is causing depression and anxiety! This is the problem!</p>
        <p>So, how do we fix it? The answer is simple. <strong>We don't</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is because school is the <strong>completely wrong place to look</strong>.</p>
        <p>School does not cause depression, nor does it cause anxiety. It is only when one lacks the motivation, will, or mood to actually do his schoolwork that he may end up depressed.</p>
        <p>But do you know the largest causes of low motivation, low willpower, and bad mood are?</p>
        <h2>The real cause</h2>
        <p>It's been known for some time that chronic stress caused by working a day job can wreak havoc upon the body and brain. This can very easily cause anxiety... but teenagers aren't working all-day jobs! Therefore, that's not the cause.</p>
        <p>I've run out of falsehoods so I'm just going to tell you now.</p>
        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>It has been proven time and time again that social media does absolutely nothing beneficial for you.</p>
        <p>Here are a list of it's potential benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-term happiness from seeing a funny post or getting a few likes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Huh, that little? Okay, it must be fine then, if there aren't any downsides... Let's look at those!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Addiction: requiring social media to have any happiness or motivation</li>
            <li>Loads of wasted time from mindlessly scrolling through feeds</li>
            <li>Anxiety & Depression from seeing others have it "better" (through edited photos and fake stories)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ah, would you look at that!</p>
        <p>It's pretty much designed to give you anxiety. People inherently believe they are better than everyone else (ever seen a freshman?). Because of this, to reassure themselves, they have to created edited photos, fake stories, and more, to give off the impression to others that they live lavishly.</p>
        <p>This creates jealousy. Hmm, now what were 2 of the Seven Sins?</p>
        <p><strong>Greed and Envy</strong>.</p>
        <p>Continuing on, when you see these fake lavish lifestyles, you automatically think, "Man, this guy has it so much better than me. I will never be able to be like him!"</p>
        <p>You might not realize it at first, but this will very quickly get out of hand. A few scrolls through a few Instagram accounts and bam, body dysmorphia and depression.</p>
        <p>I think I've made my point. Now onto other causes...</p>
        <h3>Porn</h3>
        <p>Oh dear, where do I start with this? This can be a very "adult-oriented" topic, but bear with me.</p>
        <p>You've no doubt seen at least one person on Reddit repeat one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Porn is healthy</li>
            <li>Porn is 100% natural</li>
            <li><a href="https://img.ifunny.co/images/148a968c2ea11676b3213965018bf02fb3ce30f9bf1d814da125f08b95d9664d_1.webp">If you don't watch porn what do you think about all day?</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's no secret at this point that a very large portion of Redditors are addicted to porn.</p>
        <p>But fear not: The Science(TM) says that you can't get addicted to porn!</p>
        <p><a href="http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/23086/1/23086%20Duffy%20-%20Porn%20Addiction%20Review%202017%20repository.pdf">We all have our delusions, I guess.</a></p>
        <p>Let's look through the benefits of porn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-term happiness from watching & masturbating</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the detriments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Addiction: you become increasingly dependent on porn to give you sexual stimulation.</li>
            <li>Loads of wasted time from watching so much porn (finding the "perfect video" to finish)</li>
            <li>Anxiety & Depression: from seeing these staged videos and thinking that you'll never get to have that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Doesn't that seem just a bit familiar?</p>
        <p>And doesn't it seem odd that both are consequences of great sins? (this case, <strong>lust</strong>.)</p>
        <p>I could go on and on and on about the effects of porn on you.</p>
        <p>But let's move on to a more current issue...</p>
        <h3>Lockdowns</h3>
        <p>Note that this works by a much different mechanism than the previous two.</p>
        <p>I have never discussed the ongoing feardemic and never will. It is a subject filled with so much BS and fearmongering that it's not even safe to engage in a small discussion about it, let alone state my opinions.</p>
        <p>But I absolutely will discuss the response.</p>
        <p>Lockdowns, Quarantines, Masks, and social distancing are the most widespread measures used in the past 2 years.</p>
        <p>Let's break each one down.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lockdowns: Lack of human interaction</li>
            <li>Quarantines: ditto</li>
            <li>Masks: Reduced ability to communicate properly</li>
            <li>Social Distancing: Lack of direct human contact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Curious how every single "measure" involves a disruption in human interactions & communication... almost like it's causing us to be depressed.</p>
        <p>One of my friends was forced to quarantine (from now on, let's call it what it is: house arrest), and she became really depressed afterwards, and sometimes even refuses to talk to people for the entire day. Just 5 days away from other people can do numbers on mental health. And that's just the beginning.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, the rest is easy to understand. Unless you're the world's biggest introvert (and no, you are not), reduced ability to communicate will do serious damage to you.</p>
        <p>Continuing on...</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>We now know what causes depression. But why do they cause depression?</p>
        <p>Dopamine is the answer.</p>
        <p>It's quite simple, really. Dopamine is what gives us the motivation to do things. It's a hormone that goes around the brain.</p>
        <p>Let's go on the example of social media.</p>
        <p>When you open up that app (notice: phones!), and you finally see a good or funny post/picture, you get a bit of dopamine. You did something, you got a reward. Monkey behavior!</p>
        <p>Now, you scroll down a bit more. Woah, another funny post! More dopamine! I feel better! Hooray!</p>
        <p>Now, you scroll down once again. Even more funny posts! The dopamine keeps going up!</p>
        <p>This goes on until you decide to close the app.</p>
        <p>But here's the problem: when do you stop?</p>
        <p>You're constantly scrolling and getting that dopamine, giving you the motivation to keep scrolling. Maybe after you see a few unfunny posts?</p>
        <p>But at the same time, your brain remembers the dopamine rush it got when it found a funny post. So you keep scrolling and scrolling to find a funny post.</p>
        <p>And this is where the problems roll in.</p>
        <p>You see, when the brain gets floods of dopamine in quick bursts, it has to build more receptors immediately; all dopamine must be used. Seems great, right?</p>
        <p>No. This does not just cause you to be able to handle more dopamine; it literally increases your baseline tolerance. You need <strong>more dopamine to feel the same thing</strong>.</p>
        <p>You can see where this is going. When your dopamine tolerance raises, you feel less motivation throughout the day. But when you finally get on social media, you get those dopamine bursts and feel motivated only to use social media.</p>
        <p>And this cycle continues forever.</p>
        <p>It is self-repeating.</p>
        <p>Social media has been updated and refined to be as quick as possible, and to give you those dopamine bursts as fast as possible. As in, social media developers <strong>want you to become addicted</strong>.</p>
        <p>To summarize: it's a vicious cycle. This can be applied to pornography as well.</p>
        <p>Do you see now why I don't use social media?</p>
        <h2>Detox</h2>
        <p>A "dopamine detox" is a very good idea for everyone.</p>
        <p>For a week, get rid of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social Media</li>
            <li>Porn</li>
            <li>Junk Food</li>
            <li>Anything you're addicted to (drugs, your prescription meds, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notice that the former two can easily be achieved by getting rid of your phone.</p>
        <p>This can seem daunting; but it's very, very easy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete social media apps off your phone</li>
            <li>Block all social media sites on your computer</li>
            <li>ditto with porn sites</li>
            <li>Destroy all your junk food</li>
            <li>ditto with your addictions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A good way to get rid of porn for good is to read the <a href="https://easypeasymethod.org">Easy Peasy Method</a>.</p>
        <p>I encourage you to try it for one week only. I promise that you will feel better, more motivated, happier, etc. than you ever have before.</p>
        <p>With that, I leave it to you.</p>
        <p>Good luck, God speed.</p>
