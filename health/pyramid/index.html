		<h1>A Better Food Pyramid</h1>
		<p>Chances are, if you've ever been to the doctor, you've seen the food pyramid, known nowadays as "MyPlate". You've probably been told that you absolutely have to follow it or else you'll be super unhealthy and you'll get heart disease, etc. Now, let me once again start this off with a real shocker: <b>the food pyramid is a complete lie.</b></p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The "food pyramid" describes the amount of each particular food group you should eat in one day. There are 2 types of food pyramids: food groups and caloric sources. Generally, the food group pyramid recommends grains, fruits, and vegetables to be the main part of a diet, with dairy and protein (meat, eggs, nuts, etc.) as a much smaller portion. The caloric source pyramid usually recommends 50-75% of your daily calories to come from carbohydrates (~10% from sugar), 10-15% from protein, and 15-30% from fat (<10% from saturated fat, ~10% from polyunsaturated fat).</p>
		<p>Sometimes, dairy is included on the side, not as part of the main "pyramid". Effectively, the food and caloric source pyramids say approximately the same thing: the vast majority of your daily food intake should be veggies, fruits, and grains.</p>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>The most modern food "pyramid" that's used nowadays is "MyPlate". MyPlate specifically recommends that your diet consist of: 40% veggies, 30% grains, 20% protein, and 10% fruits, with dairy on the side. MyPlate also recommends many things beyond this, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Switch to low-fat milk, particularly 1% or skim milk</li>
			<li>Make most of your grains "whole"</li>
			<li>Vary protein choices</li>
			<li>Reduce sodium, added sugar, and saturated fat intake as much as possible</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I don't even know where to begin with this. Some points make decent sense, particularly preferring whole grains and eating less added sugar (fructose, aka liver poison). But the rest of its recommendations are the most absurd, disgusting propaganda you'll ever see. The whole "plant > meat" thing, "saturated fat bad", etc. All of it is complete, utter propaganda. So, let's break it down.</p>
		<p>Assuming little to no dairy intake, if you follow this diet, <b>over 70% of your calories come from carbohydrates.</b> Assuming a 2,000 calorie diet, that is over <b>350 grams of carbohydrates per day</b>. It doesn't take an expert to realize how terrible of a recommendation this is. Excessive carbohydrate intake is effectively a credits warp to obesity. The modern obesity epidemic has been blamed on dietary fat intake, but the real culprit is excessive carbohydrate intake: rather than breaking down stored fat for energy, the body just uses spare carbohydrates you intake, meaning all the fat you intake is stored as body fat.</p>
		<p><a href="../basic">As I've already covered</a>, vegetables are almost completely useless. They nearly exclusively provide dietary fiber, as well as some vitamins/minerals, and rarely some protein and fat. While those all sound great, the fiber is a problem. Because we can't digest it and only a couple bacteria in our intestines can break down a little bit of it, nearly all the potential nutrients from those vegetables just comes right back out the other end. Not to mention, because it's indigestible, fiber doesn't provide any energy whatsoever, yet it's still counted as providing 4 calories per gram. If you follow this diet, 40% of the food you eat will be completely useless, providing no energy or calories. And people wonder why the modern generation is so lazy.</p>
		<p><a href="../basic">I've already covered saturated fat</a>. This diet is recommending low-fat milk, which is a terrible idea no matter what. Whole milk contains high amounts of vitamins A and D that low-fat milk lacks (as A and D are fat-soluble). In addition, its high saturated fat content helps with the production of testosterone.</p>
		<p>Sodium is an incredibly important mineral. No, it doesn't cause heart disease, unless you're intaking absolutely no potassium (which you should never do). It's important for muscle and nerve function, as well as energy. Eat as much sodium as possible; you can find it mostly in salt. Make sure you're having at least some potassium with it too, though.</p>
		<p>Fruits should rarely be included as part of meals. Fruits like grapes which are mostly sugar should be consumed before, during, and after workouts, for energy. Fruits like bananas which contain other important nutrients (i.e. potassium) should be eaten as a "snack".</p>
		<h2>Better Dieting</h2>
		<p>So, I've told you all of the problems with the modern food pyramid. Now, you probably want a better food pyramid, free of those problems. And that's what you'll get.</p>
		<p>As a disclaimer, I am not a doctor. With this diet, I do not intend to consider everyone's potential intolerances, allergies, diseases, and other problems. This diet is purely based off my own research and experience, and I advise to do your own research on these topics before adopting this diet.</p>
		<p>Let's start with the basics. The foundation of every diet should be meat (i.e. beef, pork, chicken, seafood, eggs). Humans are designed to eat meat; we're a hunter-gatherer species. After meat should be dairy. Dairy not only provides very high-quality whey and casein proteins, but lots of saturated fat, and (in milk's case), lactose. Finally, at the top should be grains. These are good for carbohydrates (energy throughout the day), and bread is great for putting a meal (like a classic American bacon and egg cheeseburger--which, by the way, is a great meal to have!) together.</p>
		<p>Vegetables, fruits, and nuts are excluded for obvious reasons discussed earlier.</p>
		<p>With this diet, here are other tips, or recommendations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Try and make as much of your fat intake from saturated fat as possible, and a little bit from monounsaturated fat. This is easy to achieve by prioritizing red meat over seafood.</li>
			<li>Avoid added sugars, period.</li>
			<li>If you're lactose intolerant, then for dairy, just eat things like aged cheese.</li>
			<li>All of your grains should be whole.</li>
			<li>Fruits should be eaten outside of meals, either for workouts or for nutrients like potassium and vitamin C.</li>
			<li>Omega-3 fatty acids are good too. Easy to find in fish--though you can just take a supplement too.</li>
			<li>Eat as much salt as you can and want. Put it on everything--your eggs, your burgers, your steaks--and I mean it. Not only does it taste great, but as discussed earlier, sodium is an important electrolyte. The chlorine in it is also good for us. Ensure that you also have potassium-rich foods throughout the day--it'll help regulate and balance your blood pressure.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Though this diet might be hard at first, the payoff will be immense. You will have massively increased protein intake, much higher energy and testosterone, general better health, confidence, and growth, and will almost certainly lose any excess fat you may have. Having adopted this diet myself (though I have more like 20-30% grains because meat and milk are EXTREMELY expensive around here), I can testify to all of this. I have never felt more confident, healthy, energetic, "manly", and overall, just "better", than after adopting this diet. Oh, and I'm growing extremely fast now--I'm in the middle of my second growth spurt right now, and this diet has catalyzed it quite well--and in fact, has caused it to onset much earlier than what the doctors said. Feel free to modify it to your needs.</p>
		<p>So, to summarize:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your food should consist of 40-45% meat, 40-45% dairy, and 10-20% grains.</li>
			<li>No added sugars, polyunsaturated fats (EXCEPT omega-3), non-whole grains, or vegetables.</li>
			<li>Calories should come from: 20-30% carbohydrates, 35-40% protein, 35-40% fat.</li>
			<li>Salt is very good, put it on everything</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is no reason not to go on this diet. If you're vegetarian, vegan, or allergic to dairy/meat, too bad, maybe you should stop being weak. Or just take allergy meds or something. Or better yet--<strong>just eat your damn meat</strong>.</p>
