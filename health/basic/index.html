		<h1>Health</h1>
		<p>Let me start you off with a real shocker: <b>you are being fed poison</b>. Not just through your mouth, but through your ears as well. For the longest time now, you've been told that vegetable oils are healthy, meat causes cancer, saturated fat kills you, cholesterol destroys your heart, etc. All of this is one thing and one thing only: false.</p>
		<p>Most "health and fitness" personalities, websites, or utilities all follow these blatant lies. For example, meat is seen as unhealthy just because of its high saturated fat content. Sure, let's just ignore that there's over 40g of protein in one small steak; it doesn't matter, because saturated fat bad!</p>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Biology time! If you already know about this or don't care, then skip it; one Page Down should do the trick, or a <code>28j</code> for any based qutebrowser users reading this.</p>
		<h3>Carbs</h3>
		<p>More accurately, carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are your sugars, fibers, and starches. They're what are usually talked about for weight loss/gain. There are a ton of carbohydrates, but here are the ones you'll see most often:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Glucose: The most basic form of sugar. Moderately sweet, the most common monosaccharide, and you've all heard of its use in plants.</li>
			<li>Galactose: Basically identical to glucose, except one bond is different somewhere, I can't remember. A bit less than half as sweet as glucose, you'll rarely find this on its own because, as its name suggests, it's one part of lactose.</li>
			<li>Fructose: By far the sweetest sugar. The most common sugar used for flavoring and general taste, especially in kid's medicine, sweets, etc.</li>
			<li>Sucrose: Now we're getting to the disaccharides. Sucrose is composed of glucose and fructose. Pretty sweet, more than glucose but less than fructose. Mostly used as table sugar.</li>
			<li>Lactose: Milk sugars. The least sweet of all sugars, at least 11x less sweet than fructose (or about 7x, depending on the scale). Composed of glucose and, you guessed it, galactose. You hear about this alot with lactose intolerance.</li>
			<li>Maltose: Composed of two glucoses. Not very sweet--usually not considered a sugar. Pretty much only seen in things like malt (hence the name).</li>
			<li>Cellulose: A polysaccharide, just a chain of glucoses. Known most commonly as fiber. Indigestible, common in vegetables, and mostly found and used in things like wood and paper.</li>
			<li>Starches: Usually polysaccharides. Most carbs are starches--they're a glucose storage for most plants (and as such, they're found commonly in most plant foods). There are various types of starches but all have the same properties in our diets.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Fats</h3>
		<p>More accurately, lipids. Not to be confused with body fat, which stores your energy. These are high in energy (9 calories per gram of fat, compared to 4 for carbs/protein) and are what we know as grease and oil. These are triglycerides: three fatty acids linked to a glycerol backbone. There are a lot of different types of fats but here's the most important:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Saturated: Animal fats. These are fatty acids that don't have any double bonds. Solid at room temperature.</li>
			<li>Unsaturated: What we call "oils" and "grease". These are fatty acids with at least one double bond. These are further broken down into monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.</li>
			<li>Monounsaturated: Unsaturated fats with just one double bond. Not talked about often, they're pretty irrelevant for diets.</li>
			<li>Polyunsaturated: Mostly found in vegetable oils. Unsaturated fats with multiple double bonds. Further broken down into omega-3 and omega-6. Omega-3 is the one you always hear about, and is very important for diets. Omega-6 is too, but it's commonly overconsumed in the West and is generally seen as much less healthy.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Proteins</h3>
		<p>You all know what protein is: the stuff that builds muscle! It's also necessary for other things (as your cells basically do everything through proteins), but the big one is muscle. I won't go into detail because amino acids are incredibly complex and this "background info" is getting too long already. In general, there are 9 essential amino acids that your body can't synthesize on its own. Not all proteins are equal, though. The highest quality proteins you'll find are milk, whey, casein, egg, pea, and beef proteins, though the latter isn't "complete" and doesn't contain all essential amino acids. Lower-quality proteins include soy, wheat, rice, oat, and peanut protein. There are much more factors than this (digestibility, absorption, etc.) but like I said this section is way too long already.</p>
		<h3>Vitamins</h3>
		<p>These are your essential, organic micronutrients. Can't be synthesized in the body and as such are necessary for us to have good, functioning bodies. Most are incredibly important for the immune system, and as such it's important to intake as much as possible. There are 6 essential vitamin (groups): A, the B group, C, D, E, and K. Most are found in eggs, meat, dairy, and fruits/vegetables. D can also be synthesized from sunlight exposure. If you want a strong immune system, vitamins are the way to go. Not only that, but B vitamins help out with many things, like digestion, muscle function, skin health, etc.</p>
		<h3>Minerals</h3>
		<p>Similar case to vitamins, though these are usually just metals. Many are crucial for a LOT of things, like immune health, functioning body processes, oral, muscular, and organ health, and general energy, and much more. In general, the most important ones are: iron, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Many more are still highly important though, so if you can, take a multivitamin or eat foods with lots of minerals.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Honestly this was way too long and doesn't serve too much purpose for this page but it's good to know what the stuff is before you learn what the good/bad stuff is.</p>
		<h2>The Goods and the Bads</h2>
		<p>This is a small list of what foods/nutrients are good and which ones are bad. I'll include a short description, but some will be discussed in detail later.</p>
		<p>Good:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Protein</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Protein = muscle. Simple as that. Intake lots of protein 10-15 minutes after workouts and right before bed. The former will help to build muscle as your fibers start to rebuild after breaking down during a workout, and the latter increases your testosterone. Not all proteins are good, as I pointed out earlier. Avoid soy and general plant proteins, except peas, and try and stick to dairy, egg, and meat proteins. Read <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/male-height-animal-protein-consumption/">here</a> about the best proteins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Saturated Fat</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Almost all of the modern "saturated fat bad, unsaturated fat good", "meat bad, plants good", etc. rhetorics nowadays are pretty much entirely based off of some "research" by Ancel Keys, "research" which he himself has admitted was wrong, and "research" which has been demolished countless times. There's a good page <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/the-truth-about-saturated-fat/">here</a> which highlights its benefits. I can speak from experience with their first listed benefit--I recently have drastically increased my saturated fat intake and I have noticed much, much better growth, stronger muscles, and all of the benefits of high testosterone. This (iirc) is because saturated fat is a precursor to cholesterol, which is further a precursor to testosterone. If you care about health, <b>saturated fat is the way to go!</b></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Cholesterol</li>
			<ul>
				<li>For some reason, modern "scientists" and health organizations have been constantly saying that cholesterol is a poison, to eat as little of it as possible, and that it'll kill your heart... while also saying eggs are healthy. Cholesterol has SERIOUS benefits for muscle building. Eat lots of whole eggs, particularly before bed; the protein in them is also obviously great, but if you eat some before bed, your testosterone will increase dramatically thanks to the cholesterol. As stated earlier, cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone--so there's literally no reason not to ingest as much as possible. Oh and no, dietary cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are not correlated. Further reading <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/cholesterol-what-you-should-know-2021/">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Meat</li>
			<ul>
				<li>High in protein and saturated fat. Pretty obvious choice. And no, it doesn't cause cancer, literally all of the "studies" which claim this have been analyzed and no actual correlation was shown. Prefer higher-fat, tougher cuts of red meats--it'll give your jaws more action and, of course, give you more saturated fat! And no, this does <strong>not</strong> include plant-based """meat""". Soyburgers <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/plant-based-meat-alternatives-processed-food/">are not healthy</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Vitamins & Minerals</li>
			<ul>
				<li>I can not express just how incredibly important vitamins and minerals are. They boost your immune system, regulate bodily functions, can increase testosterone, improve brain function, strengthen your muscles, give you energy, and so, so much more. Take a multivitamin with lots of magnesium, zinc, iron, and high contents of A-E vitamins. You will not believe the benefits it'll give.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Milk (and all dairy products)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Contains almost all essential minerals and vitamins, high in "good" protein, lots of fat (both saturated and unsaturated), and lactose, pretty much the "best" sugar. Similar to meat, the studies that say it causes cancer or is killing you are completely wrong and there's no actual correlation. All dairy products are great too--aged cheese and <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/you-should-be-eating-butter/">butter</a> especially. Once again, this does <strong>not</strong> include plant-based """milk""".</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Whole Eggs</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Eggs are high in cholesterol, various vitamins/minerals, protein, and saturated fat. I don't think much more needs to be said. Here are some benefits of consuming whole eggs: <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/eggs-decrease-insulin-resistance/">decreased insulin resistance (which is quite good)</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28978542/">they're quite anabolic</a>, and of course, all the benefits of saturated fat and cholesterol. Simply put, <strong>there is literally no reason not to eat whole eggs--and lots of them.</strong></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Bad:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sugar</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You've all heard the lectures from your parents and teachers. But they're right this time--sugar is TERRIBLE for you, <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/sugar-brain-development-adolescence/">especially if you're an adolescent.</a> Don't take this as "all carbs are bad" though; carbs are very important for living. However, avoid straight-up sugars like glucose and fructose; instead, if you need carbs, cellulose and lactose are the way to go. Though there are cases where glucose is good--before workouts (20-30 mins before), after workouts (10-15 mins after, helps give energy to rebuild muscle), and earlier on in the day when you need energy. In any case, though; avoid fructose and starches as much as possible.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Soy</li>
			<ul>
				<li>To be honest, I don't think I need to explain this. It's a phytoestrogen (destroys the endocrine system, acts as an estrogen), contains low-quality proteins, high in omega-6 fatty acids (already overconsumed a lot in the west), low in omega-3, mostly unsaturated fat, and is hard to digest. That's just scratching the surface. Never, ever touch soy.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Polyunsaturated Fat</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Where do I even BEGIN with this? Because I don't want this summary to be too long, just read <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/vegetable-oil-the-worst-thing/">here</a> for why they're so bad and why they became used so much recently.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>Fitness</h2>
		<p>The vast majority of people today are just lazy, obese Redditors who can do nothing but consoom Funko Pops, drink Soylent for every meal, and stuff their face with 16" pizzas and ice cream. If you don't want to be like that, then you need to do one thing: exercise. Lifting, cardio, you name it, you do it.</p>
		<h3>Lifting</h3>
		<p>Lifting burns a lot of calories and builds muscle. Finding a good routine can be tough, but talk to some bros online and they'll probably help you. Start off slow, and gradually make your routines more intensive and lift heavier and heavier weights. Learn proper form, follow the nutritional advice I listed above, and talk to people online; they'll be glad to help.</p>
		<p>To get started lifting, you only need:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dumbbells and a rack</li>
			<li>Bench</li>
			<li>Barbell</li>
			<li>Barbell weights + rack for storage</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That's it. That's all you need. I only have these available and I've made some great progress. You don't need to consoom all the fancy machines or get a gym membership. Those are huge wastes of money, and a bench, dumbbells, and a bar give you significantly more freedom than those. In fact, you can even completely omit the barbell, as usually it and dumbbell are interchangeable. Bench isn't even necessary either, but it's useful for quite a few exercises to have one.</p>
		<h4>Splits</h4>
		<p>Splits depend on your schedule. For example, here's mine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday/Thursday: Chest, Triceps, Forearms + Shoulders</li>
			<li>Tuesday/Friday: Back, Biceps, Forearms + Shoulders</li>
			<li>Wednesday/Friday: Legs, Core</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Work your splits around your lifestyle, not the other way around.</p>
        <p>Also, this is misleading. I'll write a more detailed page on it later. You'll find it <a href="../lifting">here</a></p>
		<h4>Exercises</h4>
		<p>Don't go with the fancy machine exercises or random, completely useless movements. Find good exercises for each group. Here are some examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chest: Presses, Push-Ups, Flyes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to target the upper, mid, and lower chest evenly, then hit flat benches/push-ups/flyes.</li>
                <li>If you need extra stimulation in the upper or lower, hit decline (lower chest) or incline (upper) benches, or high-to-low flyes (lower).</li>
                <li>Dips are also a good alternative for the lower chest.</li>
            </ul>
			<li>Back: Rows, Pullups</li>
			<ul>
                <li>Upper Back (Traps): Rows (DB or bar), pullups</li>
                <li>Middle Back: Rows, esp. chest-supported.</li>
				<li>Lower Back: Deadlifts</li>
				<li>Lats: Lat Pulldowns, DB Pullovers, Rows, Pullups</li>
                <li>In essence, you can hit your entire back with some barbell rows, and deadlifts.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Legs</li>
			<ul>
                <li>Hamstrings: Deadlifts (esp. Romanian), Leg Curls</li>
				<li>Quads: All squat variations, wall sits, Lunges, Deadlifts (Sumo and Trap Bar)
                    <li>Calves: Calf Raises, soccer</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Arms</li>
			<ul>
                <li>Biceps: Curls, Pullups</li>
                <li>Triceps: Benches/Pushups (esp. close-grip), Tricep Pulldowns, Dips, Skull Crushers</li>
                <li>Forearms:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For grip strength and endurance: Dead Hangs, Towel Holds, Plate Pinches</li>
                    <li>For general wrist and finger strength: Wrist Curls and Extensions</li>
                </ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Shoulders</li>
			<ul>
                <li>Front Delts: Bench Presses, Overhead/Arnie Presses</li>
                <li>Mid Delts: Lateral Raises, Overhead/Arnie Presses</li>
				<li>Rear Delts: Barbell Rows (esp. snatch grip), Face Pulls, Reverse Flyes</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
        <p>Don't worry, you don't have to do all of these. I'll write a more detailed page on good exercises (as well as figuring out what muscle groups will be worked my certain movements) later. You'll find it <a href="../lifting">here</a></p>
		<h4>Tips</h4>
		<p>Don't hurt yourself. If you do hurt yourself, you might not be able to work out for a bit--and that's not good.</p>
		<p>Always warm up your exercise before doing it--try around 15-20 reps with a lighter weight before getting into the main exercise. This breaks down muscle fibers and prepares your nervous system.</p>
		<p>Don't specifically target looks--because those pretty much only matter for your biceps. Only focus on getting stronger, as, even if your muscles don't get huge, you'll look much better because of the increase in testosterone.</p>
		<p>If you want, log your workouts; what exercises you did, how many sets and how many reps, and weight used. This will help you track progress and you'll probably be more confident in yourself because of your progress.</p>
		<p>When doing multiple sets, do a 8-8-11 rep rhythm. You'll start off using less energy, and end off using all the energy you have.</p>
		<p>Do the easier exercises first and the hardest ones last--it'll prepare and warm you up for the hard ones.</p>
		<p>For most muscle groups, it matters more to have more time under tension, as that'll build more muscle--especially with your arms. For example, with bench presses, go down for 3 seconds and up for 3 seconds.</p>
		<p>Unless you're lifting incredibly heavy weights or have been lifting for a long while and can't make progress, preworkouts shouldn't be needed. Once you start doing very intensive workouts though, go for it.</p>
		<p>Don't stretch before workouts, and instead, stretch afterwards. Stretching beforehand can worsen your performance.</p>
		<p>While it's good to have protein before/after your workout, in reality, you only need to have some protein in your system after the workout. This is why you should have chocolate milk before and after--lots of glucose (energy for the workout and building muscle after), lactose (absorbed slower, might "kick in" towards the latter half of the workout), and protein (a whey-casein blend, which, with the milk's extra fat, can allow protein synthesis for up to 8 hours!). Or, you can have regular milk and have it a longer time before.
		<p>Carbs are good for before and after your workout, but intra-workout can also seriously help. Especially simple sugars like glucose, as those will absorb very quickly, giving you some extra energy while you lift.</p>
		<p>If you're young, and especially if you're in the middle of puberty: <b>lifting is extremely important.</b> The earlier you start working out, the better your gains will be later on. When you're still growing, you've got tons of growth hormones, which can help with hyperplasia, or increasing muscle fiber count, something which is very hard to do once you start losing testosterone (around 23/25 years old).</p>
		<p>Don't buy lifting gear like gloves or pads. For one, you're a coward if you do that. Second, direct skin contact with the bar/dumbbell forms calluses, which are very important for good muscle growth. You know the "die a man, live a coward" thing? Yeah this is "live a man, die a coward".</p>
		<p>Make sure you target ALL of your muscles. All your lifts are limited by your extremities. For example, if your hands are weak, then all exercises that use your hands will be bottlenecked. When you plateau, you'll want to work on the furthest part first then work your way in; i.e. forearms -> bi/triceps -> shoulders -> chest/back.</p>
		<h3>Cardio</h3>
		<p>I don't do too much cardio, but its benefits are pretty self-explanatory. Your heart's the most important muscle in your body (maybe except for the brain). Work it out and keep it healthy. It'll also help increase lung capacity and you'll lose fat too. Don't do too much, though, as you can lose your gains from lifting.</p>
		<p>If you want advice on this, ask people online--I'm not exactly an expert.</p>
		<h3>Dieting & Hunger</h3>
		<p>Strict diets are almost never necessary. Basically, eat a balanced diet (35-30-35), don't eat too much or too little, lots of protein, and minerals.</p>
		<p>Diets are only necessary for weight loss pretty much, in which case, go with ketosis or intermittent fasting. Ketosis's not too hard, actually; just eat LOTS of meat and eggs.</p>
		<p>However, when trying to not overeat, you might get hungry a lot. It happened to me at one point. Couldn't suppress my hunger no matter what. But for hunger, there's one simple solution: <b>eat dairy products.</b> Not only is dairy in general INCREDIBLY healthy, but its proteins are the single best hunger curb you can get (except crack but let's not go there). Whey helps curb it immediately and for a short time, and then casein kicks in afterwards and keeps you "full" for a long while. Whenever I feel hungry, I just grab a bit of cheese and a few minutes later, I'm good. Any dairy product works, though, especially the more "concentrated" stuff like cheese. Basically, if you're hungry, <b>stuff your face with cheese.</b></p>
		<h4>General Nutrition and Eating Habits</h4>
		<p>If you don't want to go on a strict diet but want some tips on nutrition and eating in general, here you go.</p>
		<p>Breakfast is a complete lie only invented to get you to eat sugary pancakes and donuts to destroy your liver. You only need 1-2 meals a day, always dinner but sometimes lunch. The rest should just be snacks.</p>
		<p>You should eat fruits during, before, and after workouts, and usually avoid them otherwise. For this purpose, grapes are the best. Bananas are good as a small snack in case you haven't had enough food in a given day and can help with your stomach, as well as for potassium. Actually, fruits can be a good source of vitamins if your diet otherwise lacks them--oranges for vitamin C, bananas for potassium, Blueberries/Grapes for vitamin K, etc. However, all other vitamins--especially A, B, and D vitamins--as well as a wide variety of minerals, are found most in meat. Certain vitamins (e.g. E) and minerals (e.g. magnesium, iron, and zinc) are also found in nuts.</p>
		<p>Vegetables are almost completely useless. They are nutrient-poor, usually almost completely impossible to digest (meaning what little nutrients they may have won't all get absorbed), hard to chew (our teeth are designed for fruits, nuts, and meat, not veggies), and can have terrible health effects. The only vegetable you should really ever eat is peas due to their much easier digestion, chewing, and their high-quality proteins. Some like lettuce can be alright if you just want some extra taste to your food or if you're having stomach problems. Avoid things like soy at all cost.</p>
		<p>However, fruits aren't nearly as bad. Since they're lower in fiber and way easier to digest, you can actually get their nutrients--almost always simple sugars like glucose, and various vitamins/minerals (as stated earlier). Plus, they actually have a designated taste in our taste buds, unlike vegetables.</p>
		<p>Vegetarian, and especially vegan, diets are absolutely terrible for you. Humans are omnivores, and to an extent, carnivores. Our teeth are literally designed to chew up meat. Our bodies are designed for meat. Our entire anatomy is designed for hunting. Vegetarian and vegan diets tend to lack protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol, all of which are hugely important for high testosterone and gains. If you really have to go vegetarian, then make sure you have lots of eggs and dairy products as those are your best alternatives to meat. Further reading <a href="https://herculeanstrength.com/low-fat-decreases-testosterone-levels/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Protein shakes are great. You should always get one. If you do, however, make sure it's not soy protein, and instead, try and find one with a whey-casein blend, lots of vitamins and minerals, high protein, and a decent amount of fat. That'll allow protein synthesis for up to 8 hours! Egg, meat, and pea proteins are also decent (the latter is okay if you're vegan), but a whey-casein blend is THE best. And, if you want to beef up your shake even more, then you can make the based blend: 6oz whole milk, 1 raw egg, 2 tbsp peanut butter, and 1 (or 2) scoops protein powder. Before you scream "muh salmonella", <a href="https://www.australianeggs.org.au/facts-and-tips/eating-raw-eggs">it's not a problem</a>. If you're really scared, buy egg whites that have been pre-cooked to remove the bacteria. To make it, just add the milk, eggs, peanut butter, and powder, then shake, and afterwards add a bit of water until it's nice and liquidy. Drink one in the morning and one at night, giving you protein synthesis while you sleep and during the day. If you want, you can have a 3rd one, exactly 8 hours after the morning one. But I don't recommend this, as you'll need some solid food both for digestion and so your jaw doesn't turn into the Soylent jawline.</p>
		<p>All parts of animals are great for you. Of course there's the muscle, but other good parts include liver, kidney, and in some cases lung. The liver especially has TONS of nutrients; but don't eat too much or you might overdose on Vitamin A.</p>
		<p>Cold exposure is a great way to lose fat. When exposed to cold, your body uses energy to keep its internal temperature normal, burning fat in the process. Go outside more and wear thinner/less clothing during the winter (especially if you're in a cold area), and turn your AC to a lower temperature and turn on fans.</li>
		<h3>Further Reading/Watching</h3>
		<p>These cover some of the more advanced parts of fitness, from standard hypertrophy (increasing muscle size), to restricting blood flow, to hyperplasia (increasing muscle fiber count), to myonuclei overload and much, much more. I highly recommend reading/watching these when you get the chance.</p>

		<h2>But Fatphobia!</h2>
		<p>The largest corporations, organizations, and personalities are all trying to say that fitness and health are somehow rooted in "fatphobia" and "white supremacy". You've got articles like <a href="https://asweatlife.com/2020/07/thin-privilege-and-fat-phobia/">this</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/equality-includes-you/the-surprising-link-between-fitness-and-racism-866039cec2ae/">this</a> (WARNING: the preceding links are on soysites with loads of gigabloated JS, spyware, and tracking. Please make sure ad/tracker blocking is ON), trying to encourage people to not be fit or healthy, and to instead be obese, soy-drinking Redditors, because they can't think for themselves. Fatphobia is not a problem. You chose to be fat, I have absolutely every right to make fun of you. Crying won't solve your problems.</p>
		<p>Being healthy and exercising properly are one of the easiest ways to make megacorporations and Redditors seethe at you, apart from using free, open software without spyware. As I already said, they'll start crying about "fatphobia" and "white supremacism" and immediately try to censor everything you say. Or, they'll get angry mobs to attack you--to no avail. Simply put: lift and laugh.</p>
		<p>Oh yeah, and I completely neglected to mention <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/j5e3z7/gym-bros-more-likely-to-be-right-wing-assholes-science-confirms">this absolute fucking abomination</a> (WARNING: this site also contains loads of gigabloated JS and soyware, so much in fact that it crashes qutebrowser when I try to load it). In case your browser can't load it, the title is literally "Gym Bros More Likely to be Right-Wing Assholes, Science Confirms". To be honest, I don't think I need to explain everything that is wrong with that article. And Good Lord I don't even want to either. I think <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/g/1625637144674.jpg">this image</a> sums it up (and explains all this) quite nicely. I've read it before and yeah, it's just as bad as you think. The opening paragraph literally reads:</p>
		<p>"To all you gym-bro haters amongst us, come, be seated. This one's for you. Science—objective, empirically tested science, the science that tells us that the ice caps are melting—has confirmed what many of us have long suspected: Gym bros are right-wing jerks."</p>
		<p>This honestly reads like a hyperironic copypasta (but all Vice articles do, dear God). "The Science(TM) has spoken! Our beliefs are correct and the #SOYENTISTS have confirmed it! You're just a dumb bigot, listen to the SOYENCE!". Speaking of irony, isn't it kinda ironic that these tards are implying that "gym-bro haters" are sus ("...gym-bro haters amongst us")? To be honest I don't know why I decided to write that but it's a good testimony to how badly this article has fried my brain.</p>
		<h2>TL;DR</h2>
		<p>Good: Protein (from dairy, eggs, and meat), saturated fat, cholesterol (egg yolks have a lot), vitamins/minerals, milk, meat. Bad: unsaturated fats, soy, sugar. Lift a lot, and work your schedule around your lifestyle. Don't use fancy machines, just use dumbbells, a bench and a bar. Cardio is good too. Working out makes big corporations and Redditors seethe!</p>
